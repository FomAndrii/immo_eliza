## remarks
  - add new_env in gitignore file to no push it on remote
  - .ipynb_checkpoints not necessary
  - missing typing and docstring :cry:
  - you did clean the git repo by removing useless branches :thumbsup:
  - You could've created a "main.py" file to orchestrate the different steps but to do this you should've used OOP to create different classes (scraper, cleaner) with multiple methods you could've called in main. 
  - I know the group work has not been easy because of An departure and Dhanya absence but you managed well! :fire:
  - This is a good project :fire:
